   - Examples: Lightweight models (MobileNetV2 for Raspberry Pi) or high-performance models (ResNet152 for
     desktop systems).

3. Resource Management and Optimization:
   - The ResourceGovernor class optimizes system resources by configuring CPU governors, limiting memory usage,
     and managing power consumption—crucial for resource-constrained devices.

4. Hardware Integration for Embedded Systems:
   - The PiCameraAdapter module provides efficient camera interfacing on the Raspberry Pi,
     enabling real-time visual diagnostics.
   - Additional GPIO support facilitates integration with sensors and other peripherals.

5. Modular and Extensible Architecture:
   - The NeuraLinkCore class orchestrates platform detection, AI processing, resource management, and hardware
     interfaces in a unified main loop, ensuring scalability and ease of future enhancements.

Architecture and Implementation:
---------------------------------
1. Platform Detection and Configuration:
   - Environment checks (e.g., presence of /etc/rpi-issue, mobile-specific environment variables) are used to
     determine the current platform.
   - Loads a configuration dictionary with performance profiles (AI model choice, refresh rate, thread count).

2. AI Model Processing:
   - Dynamically loads the appropriate AI model based on platform settings.
   - Implements robust error handling with fallbacks in case model loading fails.

3. Resource Management:
   - Adjusts CPU frequency, memory limits, and power optimizations based on the target platform.
   - Critical for ensuring smooth operation on embedded and mobile devices.

4. Hardware Integration:
   - Raspberry Pi-specific modules (like PiCameraAdapter) ensure proper initialization of camera hardware
     and GPIO interfaces.
   - Supports real-time image/video capture and sensor integration.

5. Core Execution Loop:
   - The NeuraLinkCore class initializes all modules and enters a continuous main loop.
   - Selects platform-specific routines (e.g., _desktop_loop, _mobile_loop, _pi_loop) to handle diagnostics,
     ensuring reliability and scalability.

Getting Started:

==================================================.  Key Features 	•	Universal Platform Detection: A robust PlatformManager class automatically detects the operating environment (desktop, mobile, or Raspberry Pi) and loads appropriate configurations. This ensures that platform-specific optimizations are applied seamlessly. 	•	Dynamic AI Model Loading: The AIProcessor module intelligently loads AI models based on the detected platform. For example, it selects lighter, quantized models (e.g., MobileNetV2 for Raspberry Pi) or more powerful models (e.g., ResNet152 for desktop systems) to optimize performance without compromising accuracy. 	•	Resource Management and Optimization: The ResourceGovernor class manages system resources by configuring CPU governors, limiting memory usage, and optimizing power consumption. This is crucial for maintaining performance on resource-constrained devices, particularly in embedded systems. 	•	Hardware Integration for Embedded Platforms: For Raspberry Pi deployments, the project includes a PiCameraAdapter for efficient camera interfacing, enabling the capture of real‑time video data for diagnostics. Additional GPIO initialization supports integration with other sensors and peripherals. 	•	Modular and Extensible Architecture: The core logic is encapsulated within the NeuraLinkCore class, which orchestrates platform detection, AI processing, and resource management in a unified main loop. This modular design facilitates future enhancements and custom integrations.  Architecture and Implementation  Platform Detection and Configuration  The PlatformManager class is the first component to initialize upon startup. It performs environment detection using the following criteria: 	•	Raspberry Pi: Checks for specific system files (e.g., /etc/rpi-issue). 	•	Mobile Devices: Looks for mobile-specific environment variables (e.g., ANDROID_ARGUMENT for Android or iOS_SIMULATOR for iOS). 	•	Desktop: Defaults to desktop configuration if none of the above conditions are met.  After detection, it loads a corresponding configuration dictionary containing performance profiles such as AI model choice, refresh rate, and thread count.  AI Model Processing  The AIProcessor class leverages the configuration provided by the PlatformManager to load the most appropriate AI model. Key elements include: 	•	Dynamic Loading: Based on the platform-specific configuration, the processor will dynamically load TensorFlow Lite models for lightweight environments or PyTorch models for systems with greater computational power. 	•	Error Handling and Fallbacks: The code is designed with robust error handling to catch model load failures and revert to a fallback model, ensuring uninterrupted diagnostics.  Resource Management  The ResourceGovernor class plays a pivotal role in resource optimization: 	•	Embedded Systems: On Raspberry Pi, it adjusts CPU frequency and memory usage to optimize performance and energy consumption. 	•	Mobile Devices: Implements power optimization routines to extend battery life during diagnostics.  Hardware Integration  For platforms like Raspberry Pi, the PiCameraAdapter ensures that camera modules are properly initialized and configured for capturing high-quality images or video streams. This integration is critical for real-time visual diagnostics in test scenarios.  Core Execution Loop  The NeuraLinkCore class ties all modules together. It initializes the platform, AI processing, resource management, and hardware interfaces. The main loop runs continuously, selecting platform-specific routines (e.g., _desktop_loop, _mobile_loop, _pi_loop) based on the environment.
